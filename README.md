# Insomniometer

A tiny little HUD trinket to warn you when Minecraft's most annoying mob is about to spawn.

## Warning level 1: Phantoms don't spawn yet, but they will in half a day

<img alt="A phantom with green eyes" height="128" src="src/main/resources/assets/insomniometer/textures/insomnia/phantom.png" width="128"/>

## Warning level 2: Phantoms are currently spawning

<img alt="A phantom with red eyes" height="128" src="src/main/resources/assets/insomniometer/textures/insomnia/phantom_red.png" width="128"/>

#### Note that the images won't look quite as blurry in-game; GitHub's README incorrectly scales these images, making them very blurry

##### Here is a crispier, but significantly downscaled version of the icons.
